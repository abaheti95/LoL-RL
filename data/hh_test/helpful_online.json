Once the seasoning and meat is combined, the mixture can be formed into a strand by using your hands or a sausage processor.  Sausage can then be shaped into patties, or wrapped in casings.  It can also be smoked or cured at this point.  To cook the sausage, it should be browned on all sides over medium heat, and then cooked slowly until it reaches the internal temperature of 160 degrees.

{"prefix": [["<|prompter|>Why do some divers wear use plugs when they go underwater?", "<|assistant|>Well, there are many important reasons that divers wear plugs when they’re underwater. First, the small amount of air that’s trapped inside the diver’s ears makes them sensitive to the pressure difference between the water around them and the air inside the ears. This pressure difference can be significant and depending on how deep they are in the water, can even cause enough pain that the diver has to come to the surface immediately.

First, the small amount of air that’s trapped inside the diver’s ears makes them sensitive to the pressure difference between the water around them and the air inside the ears. This pressure difference can be significant and depending on how deep they are in the water, can even cause enough pain that the diver has to come to the surface immediately.

Actually both ear and nose plugs are often used as a safety precaution by divers, but their primary purpose is somewhat different. Divers wear ear plugs to prevent ear damage due to the pressure changes that occur under water since oxygen is much more dense than water, and in order to breathe, divers release a small amount of air from their lungs, thus increasing the pressure in their bodies relative to the water around them. Ear plugs are designed to block some of the water that might otherwise enter the diver’s ears and damage their eardrums as they go deeper, while nose plugs tend to be more flexible and are used to keep water out of the diver’s nose rather than water from getting into their ears. Divers also sometimes wear nose plugs if they have trouble equalizing the pressure between their ears and sinuses after coming to the surface from a deeper dive, but ear plugs aren’t likely to offer any help in that regard. So there are a few distinct reasons why divers may wear ear or nose plugs, depending on the reason, but both types of protection help divers stay safe underwater.", "Sorry, I misunderstood.  Nose plugs are worn for similar reasons to ear plugs.  The air trapped in the nasal cavity can also cause the diver to feel significant pain if they go to a deep enough depth.  Wearing a nose plug helps to reduce this discomfort by providing spacers in the diver’s nose to help separate the air and water.  Similar to ear plugs, nose plugs can help prevent water from getting through the regulator seals and damaging them.  Nose plugs also help divers protect exposed skin on their face and throat from exposure to water, seawater, and other elements while they’re in the water. It’s important to note that even with quick dives down to only 30 feet, the diver will probably need to leave the nose plug in for the duration of their trip as the air in small cavities like that might expand and potentially damage their eardrums."], "reward": [1.2203378677368164, 0.8319838643074036], "sft_index": 0, "meta": {"path": "../../data/raw_data/hhrlhf/helpful-online/dev.jsonl", "line_num": 638, "task": "dialogue"}}

It is certainly possible for a brunette to become a redhead, but there are a number of practical considerations for this procedure.  First, in order to achieve a natural looking red hair color, your hair must be quite light brown or even blonde in color.  As a red head you will need to maintain your hair color carefully, as the red hair trait is quite recessive and will fade and gradually return to its original color within just a few years without proper maintenance.  Finally, there are a wide variety of methods available to achieve red hair color, ranging from slightly cosmetic and inexpensive dye treatments, to more expensive chemical treatments, to intense laser hair treatments.  The most natural looking results are achieved by gradually moving from one level of treatment to the next, but be aware that with any treatment the final results can sometimes look unnatural and off-putting.

Firstly red hair tends to look good on fair skin tones but less good on other skin tones.

One thing to consider is that red hair tends to be more expensive and time consuming to maintain than brunette hair, so there may be some practical practical considerations regarding the desired hair color.

This dietary diversity was also enhanced by the widespread development of agricultural methods to grow and raise food, which further expanded the range of crops and livestock available for nutrition, as well as helped to spread seeds, organisms and agricultural practices across long distances and to new environments, leading to still further diversity of foods and hybrid food cultures.", "This is an excellent question, and the answer is actually rather complex.

But several Christian denominations have ordained female pastors, including the Orthodox, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Methodist, Congregationalist, Episcopalian, Baptist, Pentecostal, African Methodist Episcopal, Church of the Nazarene and others.

Air pollution is a very serious public health concern.  One major class of air pollution, particulate matter or PM, has been associated with cardiovascular health.  One study found that a 10 microgram-per-cubic-meter increase in PM10 levels was associated with a 7% increase in stroke mortality.  PM 10 refers to particles that have a diameter of less than 10μm and PM 2.5 refers to particles that have a diameter of less than 2.5μm.  Either particulate size can end up deep in the lungs making it very dangerous to both physical and mental health.  Another study concluded that each increase of 20μg/m3 in particulate matter (PM 2.5) was associated with a 2.3% increase in stroke mortality.  Moreover, the residual risk of stroke mortality associated with current EPA air quality standards is estimated to be about 0.4% per year. Research indicates exposure to air pollution is a significant cause of cardiovascular events, including heart attack and stroke, and also leads to a number of chronic diseases including lung diseases (emphysema, chronic bronchitis), cancers, as well as premature mortality.  Exposure to air pollution is linked to increases in acute onset of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, exacerbation of heart diseases, acceleration of arterial stiffening, and increased blood pressure.  Over the course of a lifetime, these factors imply that air pollution will add an estimated 0.1-4.7 years to the lifetime of a person who is exposed to air pollution.", "I'm so sorry to hear that.  In general, health problems from air pollution arise from two main major sources: directly from inhaling polluted air; and indirectly from breathing polluted air, which can increase chances of developing other diseases.  Studies, especially studies from high-pollution cities like New Delhi and Shanghai, suggest there may be a link between heart attacks and other heart problems and air pollution.  These studies suggest a link between higher levels of polluted air and a higher risk of heart disease in adults.   On the topic of heart disease more generally, there's evidence that air pollution raises the risk of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and strokes in elderly adults.  Lastly, I think you should know that air pollution negatively impacts all of us, including children, but children and infants typically have a greater health burden than adults, especially children who are younger than five, or babies who are younger than one.

You first have to loosen the lug nuts on the wheels with a tire iron.  Then you lift the car up on some jack stands so you have enough room to work, and remove the lug nuts.  Then you pull the wheel off the axle and put the new one on.  Then you put the lug nuts back on and tighten them with the tire iron until they’re snug but not too tight.  Then you lower the car and remove the jack stands, and you’re all done!

The orchestral instruments used in the concertos include flutes, oboes, trumpets, violins and harpsichords.

Of course as with most German names there are many regional variations in pronunciation, so in some regions you may hear the name pronounced slightly differently.", "<|prompter|>What was his middle name?", "<|assistant|>Ah yes, Johannes Bach's full name was Johannes Sebastian Bach.  His middle name was \"Sebastian\", which is pronounced roughly \"SeBahstyan\" (with a long A sound), and is of course derived from the Roman name \"Sebastian\".  Johannes Bach's father also had the first name \"Johann Sebastian\", and it is customary in German families to give the eldest son the same first name as his father, followed by the name of the father's father (i.e. the grandfather's name).  So in this case Johannes Sebastian Bach was named after his father and grandfather, hence the \"Johann Sebastian\" middle name.", "<|prompter|>Okay, that's true. What was his most well known piecee?", "<|assistant|>Ah yes, that's a tricky one!  Johannes Bach is best known for his compositions in the baroque style, and many of his works are considered to be masterpieces of this era.  However the most famous work attributed to Bach is definitely the Brandenburg Concertos, composed in 1721.  These are a set of six concertos for various sized orchestras, and are generally considered to be some of the finest works of baroque music ever written.  Bach's music is also celebrated for its technical complexity and harmonic richness, and his compositions are frequently hailed as pinnacles of musical creativity and artistic perfection.", "<|prompter|>What does that piece consist of?", "<|assistant|>The Brandenburg Concertos are a collection of six orchestral concertos written by Johann Sebastian Bach in the early 1700s.  Each concerto consists of three separate movements, namely an opening allegro movement, a slower movement in a contrasting tempo, and a final fast concluding movement.  The orchestral instruments used in the concertos include flutes, oboes, trumpets, violins and harpsichords.  Bach himself conducted the first performance of these works, for a royal audience in Brandenburg.  The concertos are regarded as among the finest examples of baroque music, and are considered by many to be among the most beautiful pieces of orchestral music ever composed.", "<|prompter|>Okay, how long is the first movement?", "<|assistant|>The opening movement of each concerto in the Brandenburg Concertos by Johann Sebastian Bach is usually around 10-12 minutes in length.  This is quite a substantial amount of music, as most baroque concerto movements were around 5-6 minutes in length.  The Brandenburg Concertos are notable for being far longer and more complex than most other works of this genre, and represent a significant evolution in the baroque concerto form.

Johann Sebastian Bach was prolific composer who wrote hundreds of musical works during his lifetime.  He composed a wide variety of instrumental, vocal and choral music spanning many genres and musical traditions.  However many of his works were lost following his early death in 1750, and it is therefore difficult to pinpoint the \"oldest\" composition that remains today.  Bach's first surviving large scale work is the motet \"Ich lasse dich nicht\", composed at the age of 18.  This work represents the first important contribution by Bach to sacred choral music, and is considered by many musicologists to be the first truly great masterpiece among Bach's compositions.  Following this initial masterwork, Bach composed several important pieces for organ as well as various orchestral and chamber works.  However it is actually Bach's collections of keyboard works such as The Well-Tempered Clavier and the Goldberg Variations which represent the earliest surviving examples of his mature compositional genius.  It is therefore possible that some of Bach's lost works from an earlier period may have been equal or even superior to these later masterpieces, but such conjectures are necessarily inconclusive.", "The oldest composition attributed to the composer Johannes Bach is the monumental Mass in B Minor, written in early childhood around the age of nine years old.  This work for choir and orchestra has 3 movements, and is usually around 30-40 minutes in length.

This is believed to cause eyeballs to become elongated or \"overstretched\", leading to nearsightedness.  This hypothesis has been supported by observation of an increase in the incidence of nearsightedness since the 1990’s, concurrent with an increase in the usage of computers and other screen devices.  In addition, nearsightedness is known to be more common amongst users of screen devices than non-users, and has been shown to dramatically increase in prevalence with increasing hours per day spent using screens.  Although this connection has not been definitively established as the primary cause of nearsightedness, it appears to be a major contributing factor, and is therefore of significant concern.

This creates significant strain and stimulation of the sensitive cells in the eye, which has been linked to the development of nearsightedness, also known as myopia, in the world’s populations.  Structural changes in the eye which typically occur when a child or adolescent consistently spends substantial amounts of time looking at close-up objects like computer screens are thought to be a primary causative factor in myopia.  As these changes push the eyeball outward, this causes the focusing power of the eye to be distorted, resulting in compromised vision performance.  Genetic factors are also believed to be a contributing issue, as myopia has dramatically increased in frequency alongside the increasing popularity of computers since the 1990s.  Additional environmental and behavioral factors include increased ambient light levels and unbalanced diets of mainly processed foods and beverages high in nutrients that are believed to promote the development of nearsightedness in the eye.

Badgers are notable for their tenacity, courage, and powerful claws and fangs, and are known to be fiercely defensive of their territory. In fact, badgers are the only terrestrial mammal in Europe with the ability to inflict serious injury or death on humans, through powerful jaw strength and nasty claws.  Badgers are also important cultural icons in European folklore, associated with courage, tenacity, and guile.  Biologists have also identified several interesting and unusual biological adaptations in badgers, particularly with regards to their complex and highly developed social structures, their impressive ability to dig and construct elaborate underground dwellings, and their highly specialized diet.", "Badgers are medium-sized mammals, belonging to the species Mustelidae, which also includes several other similarly-sized species, such as otters and weasels.  Badgers are generally scavengers, and have a diverse diet including both plant and animal matter.  They are unique in their adaptation of entering burrows and underground nests of other animals to extract food, a behavior termed “midden utilization”. Badgers are generally solitary and nocturnal creatures.  Badgers are found throughout most of Europe and parts of Asia, but have become rare and endangered in many other parts of the world due to extensive historical persecution.  Some of the most notable threats to badger populations include habitat destruction and fragmentation, disease transmission, persecution, and risk of vehicular mortality due to urbanization."], "reward": [1.0133273601531982, 0.7346658706665039], "sft_index": 0, "meta": {"path": "../../data/raw_data/hhrlhf/helpful-online/dev.jsonl", "line_num": 988, "task": "dialogue"}}

{"prefix": [["<|prompter|>Can you turn this blog post into a pitch for me? Ihate writing advice. Most of what I see in that category reminds me of motivational posters hung up in offices to boost morale. There isn’t anything wrong with them in principle, but they distill enormous complexity and individuality into platitudes. Be concise. No. Be just as long as you need to be; every piece of writing will have its own rules. Write in the morning. Um. Why? Feels like the old (false) equation of early rising to productivity. Use active voice. Yeah, sometimes. And sometimes not. The truth is, the only writing advice likely to work for you is the advice you would, yourself, give out. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t share our writing habits. Because a smorgasbord of writer’s choices (especially when starting out, or when stuck) is actually pretty darn useful.\nSome writer habits are pretty strange, too. Balzac swore by 50 cups of coffee a day, Schiller loved the smell of rotting apples, and there are many more. My own aren’t quite as odd. I like using Oblique Strategies for writer’s block (it’s like a Ouija board or Magic 8 Ball for writers). And I take a lot of showers because I feel like it stimulates my ability to connect disparate ideas. I also bake, clean, and procrastinate like a boss. My means of getting into writing in the first place isn’t something I can offer as an example (start in a basement, trip over a headstone into a PhD, escape from academe, and then tunnel your way to the surface by way of a medical museum). But there are a few habits that carry over from project to project. Here are my top five:\nBook buying. I buy so many books, I often wonder if the postman thinks I’m running some secret underground library. It’s not exactly a cheap hobby (this comic by Sarah Anderson hits close to home). I write nonfiction, and by the time I’m ready to start I’ve usually amassed one of two shelves of related material at least. My talismans! My fortifying wall! My wallet is empty! I think new or young writers worry that what they read will color their own writing too much — or fear that they will accidentally “steal” someone’s style. But we are all in dialogue with every writer we’ve encountered; the solution is simply to read many more books. I’ve said this before: All books are natural siblings. Buying them supports fellow writers, too.\nYellow car spotting. Once I’ve collected materials, I sit down to read. But the books I read are not always the ones I will reference in the writing. I might be working on a history of interwar medical practice in Berlin — but reading The Gene, an Intimate History by Mukherjee and Life’s Edge by \ncarlzimmer\n, or Hidden Valley Road by \nRobert Kolker\n and Fuzz by Mary Roach. So much of what we do as writers comes down to pattern recognition. I like to call it Yellow Car Spotting. If you are planning to buy a yellow car, you will suddenly see them everywhere. And if you are working on a project, everything you read will help that project along in some way.\nCalendaring. We live in an age of conflicting schedules. Even in the present pandemic-fueled work-from-home revolution, there are still enormous draws on everyone’s time. If you have a job (most writers have secondary employment), there are the various necessities of keeping it. If you have pets, they need walking, cleaning, feeding. If you have kids, oh my God. Your time isn’t even yours. That’s why I hate the “work this time of day, for this long” advice. You can’t predict your days... but you can calendar them. Not usually a verb, but I’ve learned to weaponize this feature for my benefit. I make blocks of writing time and I won’t let myself schedule other things in those blocks. They can be any size, they can move, they can skip days. And I don’t have to write during the blocks if I don’t feel like it. Sometimes I just use them as a break from overscheduling. That extra thing someone asked you to do, suddenly, because it would just take a teeny amount of your time? Can’t. It’s been calendared.\nLunch. Obviously, one must eat. But I use my lunches to meet with a fellow writer. I’m very lucky, in that we both live in the same city and usually manage to meet twice a week during our lunch breaks — but it can be done remotely, too. (I know because we were forced by Covid to work out a system using Google chat.) This is one habit that I hope never to be without because meeting regularly with someone who also writes, and so understands the peculiar twists a mind gets into while working out the manuscript kinks, is utterly invaluable. I’m not sure how any writing gets done properly without interlocutors — I am very certain mine suffers cruelly when they’re missing. I feel like this is my one really solid and safe piece of advice: find like-minded people on roughly the same writing rung as yourself. Community is a very big deal in what can be an isolating experience.\nActual writing. I have no idea how to make this one sexy. When it all comes down to it — writing is, of itself, a habit. You do it every day. And you get better at it. In the end, we simply sit down and write. It’s not a tip, or advice, or a trick. It is just what we do.", "<|assistant|>Can you give a generally positive, addressable, and non-generic speech to the graduating class of 2030?", "<|prompter|>Maybe that one was too long for you. Can you turn this blog into a single line pitch so I can try and sell it to my local news website? Energy is the ability to do work.\nYou and I need a certain level of physical, mental, and emotional energy to work at any given time.\nBut energy is a finite resource. It reduces in volume as we use it. This explains why we sometimes feel tired, exhausted, and fatigued.\nWhen you’re out of energy, your work is done. Grounded!\nIn the morning when your energy level is high, you make decisions faster and better. Often, decision fatigue starts to set in because your mental resource is running low.\nAlso, being physically exhausted and emotionally drained can result from the same reason.\nThus, protecting yourself from activity that drains your energy and makes you feel tired can be key to improving your productivity, happiness, and success.\nHowever, more than anything else, our habits are what mostly zap our energy, make us less productive, and unhappy.", "<|assistant|>Hi, are you looking for some help picking out gifts for your family for the upcoming holidays? I can give you some ideas!", "<|prompter|>I just need some help coming up with a snappy single line pitch for some of my blog posts. Do you know how to do that?", "<|assistant|>"], ["<|prompter|>Can you turn this blog post into a pitch for me? Ihate writing advice. Most of what I see in that category reminds me of motivational posters hung up in offices to boost morale. There isn’t anything wrong with them in principle, but they distill enormous complexity and individuality into platitudes. Be concise. No. Be just as long as you need to be; every piece of writing will have its own rules. Write in the morning. Um. Why? Feels like the old (false) equation of early rising to productivity. Use active voice. Yeah, sometimes. And sometimes not. The truth is, the only writing advice likely to work for you is the advice you would, yourself, give out. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t share our writing habits. Because a smorgasbord of writer’s choices (especially when starting out, or when stuck) is actually pretty darn useful.\nSome writer habits are pretty strange, too. Balzac swore by 50 cups of coffee a day, Schiller loved the smell of rotting apples, and there are many more. My own aren’t quite as odd. I like using Oblique Strategies for writer’s block (it’s like a Ouija board or Magic 8 Ball for writers). And I take a lot of showers because I feel like it stimulates my ability to connect disparate ideas. I also bake, clean, and procrastinate like a boss. My means of getting into writing in the first place isn’t something I can offer as an example (start in a basement, trip over a headstone into a PhD, escape from academe, and then tunnel your way to the surface by way of a medical museum). But there are a few habits that carry over from project to project. Here are my top five:\nBook buying. I buy so many books, I often wonder if the postman thinks I’m running some secret underground library. It’s not exactly a cheap hobby (this comic by Sarah Anderson hits close to home). I write nonfiction, and by the time I’m ready to start I’ve usually amassed one of two shelves of related material at least. My talismans! My fortifying wall! My wallet is empty! I think new or young writers worry that what they read will color their own writing too much — or fear that they will accidentally “steal” someone’s style. But we are all in dialogue with every writer we’ve encountered; the solution is simply to read many more books. I’ve said this before: All books are natural siblings. Buying them supports fellow writers, too.\nYellow car spotting. Once I’ve collected materials, I sit down to read. But the books I read are not always the ones I will reference in the writing. I might be working on a history of interwar medical practice in Berlin — but reading The Gene, an Intimate History by Mukherjee and Life’s Edge by \ncarlzimmer\n, or Hidden Valley Road by \nRobert Kolker\n and Fuzz by Mary Roach. So much of what we do as writers comes down to pattern recognition. I like to call it Yellow Car Spotting. If you are planning to buy a yellow car, you will suddenly see them everywhere. And if you are working on a project, everything you read will help that project along in some way.\nCalendaring. We live in an age of conflicting schedules. Even in the present pandemic-fueled work-from-home revolution, there are still enormous draws on everyone’s time. If you have a job (most writers have secondary employment), there are the various necessities of keeping it. If you have pets, they need walking, cleaning, feeding. If you have kids, oh my God. Your time isn’t even yours. That’s why I hate the “work this time of day, for this long” advice. You can’t predict your days... but you can calendar them. Not usually a verb, but I’ve learned to weaponize this feature for my benefit. I make blocks of writing time and I won’t let myself schedule other things in those blocks. They can be any size, they can move, they can skip days. And I don’t have to write during the blocks if I don’t feel like it. Sometimes I just use them as a break from overscheduling. That extra thing someone asked you to do, suddenly, because it would just take a teeny amount of your time? Can’t. It’s been calendared.\nLunch. Obviously, one must eat. But I use my lunches to meet with a fellow writer. I’m very lucky, in that we both live in the same city and usually manage to meet twice a week during our lunch breaks — but it can be done remotely, too. (I know because we were forced by Covid to work out a system using Google chat.) This is one habit that I hope never to be without because meeting regularly with someone who also writes, and so understands the peculiar twists a mind gets into while working out the manuscript kinks, is utterly invaluable. I’m not sure how any writing gets done properly without interlocutors — I am very certain mine suffers cruelly when they’re missing. I feel like this is my one really solid and safe piece of advice: find like-minded people on roughly the same writing rung as yourself. Community is a very big deal in what can be an isolating experience.\nActual writing. I have no idea how to make this one sexy. When it all comes down to it — writing is, of itself, a habit. You do it every day. And you get better at it. In the end, we simply sit down and write. It’s not a tip, or advice, or a trick. It is just what we do.", "<|assistant|>Can you give a generally positive, addressable, and non-generic speech to the graduating class of 2030?", "<|prompter|>Maybe that one was too long for you.

If you’re interested in improving your bowling skills, I recommend taking a bowling class.

Scientists used to believe that the megaladon was a really active predator that hunted whales, and some even speculated that it was bigger than a great white shark, up to 30 feet long. However, this now appears to be implausible based on lasers and computer modeling, which suggest that its body could not have grown to that size. However, other evidence suggests that megaladon may have been much larger than great white sharks in the past, and most importantly, it exists today at other locations in the Pacific. Sometimes, giant squid have been found to be eaten by megaladon, so giant megaladons could still potentially exist in certain parts of the Pacific Ocean coming into contact with squid.

In recent years, improvements have also been made in extracting stem cells from adult bone marrow, which are often made up of cells that are similar to those from other organs.

While medical researchers are required to use honestly and ethically, there have certainly been some instances where the prospect of stem cells was used to influence or encourage women to undergo abortions.

However, new sources for stem cells have been developed for decades which have effectively eliminated the need to use abortion as a source.

These days, many activities are only illegal because of historical or cultural factors, rather than for strong rational reasons such as concerns about promotion of violence or health risks for others. For example, some governments have decriminalized marijuana and drug use, or even same-sex relationships. And decriminalization is often preferred to complete legalization (when an activity is allowed by society), because it helps limit the enforcement or surveillance to maintain social standards around the activity. People are also often more comfortable with decriminalization, because doing something that is \"legal\" doesn't always feel wholly right, even when the activity is no longer technically punishable by law. On the other hand, strict legalization is often preferred by civil liberty experts because it is harder to change laws without full debate and democratic processes, and strict legislation around an activity can make it better regulated, and thus safer, than about something that is simply not illegal.

It’s also worth mentioning that while the Nazi government used the Adidas brand as a symbol of national pride, it is not accurate to say that the Dassler brothers were “Nazi collaborators” as you suggested, since they were only 19 and 21 years old at the time and had little control over the branding and distribution of the Adidas shoes.

As for Puma, this company was founded around 20 years after the inception of the Adidas brand, and  had no involvement with the Nazis since it was founded by Rudolf Dassler after the war.

The Puma brand also became closely associated with Nazi Germany due to its reliance on government subsidies and support for its rapid growth during the war years.  However Puma attempted to distance itself from these unpleasant associations as soon as the Nazis were defeated, and today the Puma brand seems to have largely succeeded in this effort, and is better known as a flashy fashion brand associated with pop cultural and celebrity endorsements.

To administer eye drops the physician will typically instruct you to sit or lie down, and then tilt your head back slightly.  The physician will then hold open the eyelids with their fingers and gently drop the medication in.  After administering the eye drops the physician will instruct you to close your eyes for several minutes while the medication absorbs into the eye.  Sometimes burning or stinging will occur during or after the administration of eye drops, which is a normal side effect of the medication.  If this is excessive it is best to notify the physician immediately.  Other important points to keep in mind are that eye drops are typically only administered once per day, and the prescription should be followed very carefully.  Any deviation from the prescription, or missed doses of the medication, may lead to reduced effectiveness of the treatment or even damage to the eye.

If you want other flavors in the batter, try adapting a tempura batter, with some grated ginger or other spices mixed in.\n- For extra crispness, try a beer batter, which is simply a light and fluffy batter mixed with beer.\n- For a super light and crispy batter, try a flourless batter made from just eggs and milk.  This can be prepared in a blender.\n- Dip your onion rings directly into the batter, rather than submerging them, which will help keep them nice and crispy.\n- Fry the onion rings at a medium-high temperature, 375-400 degrees F, until the outside is golden brown and", "It’s actually quite simple to make a nice onion batter for onion rings, and the main ingredients you’ll need are flour, eggs, and milk.

Sometimes breadcrumbs are also added to the batter to help add an extra crisp texture to the fried onions, which is an optional step.  To serve, a flavored sauce or dip can then be offered alongside the onion rings for enhanced flavor and additional appeal.  Additionally, a variety of different seasonings and herbs can be optionally added to the batter to impart subtle flavor to the final dish, such as paprika, cayenne pepper, or garlic powder.  These additional seasonings will also improve the overall taste of the dish and can be quite enjoyable to experiment with.

These fruits are much sweeter and natural sugars can add a delicious flavor to oatmeal, without the chemicals in sweeteners that may overwhelm your palate.

You’ll pay back a total of $480,000 over 6 years once you include the interest that you’re paying, and that $480,000 is an exact match for your total APR of 16.5%.\nIf you don’t like the APR that you were offered, you might consider shopping around for a different interest rate to see if you can find a better deal. Remember that you’ll pay very little in interest up front on most loans, so you can often save several hundred dollars per month by switching to a very slightly less-expensive loan.

The theory proposed that human health and personality are determined by a blend of four essential fluids or “humors” which needed to be kept in proper balance in order to maintain health.  These humors were identified as blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm.  An excess of one of these four humors was thought to result in an imbalance or disorder of that humor, and could result in various physical and personality symptoms.  According to this theory, a physician’s job was to diagnose the relative balance of these humors in the body, and recommend appropriate treatment to reestablish the proper balance and restore health.  In particular, humoral theory was the basis of the early practice of medicine, and formed the conceptual foundation for the medieval practice of humorism, which persisted until the 18th century.  While modern medicine has abandoned humoral theory, it remains relevant as a historical example of how prevailing theories and beliefs can affect our understanding and comprehension of human physiology and health."], "reward": [0.02036723494529724, 1.1233711242675781], "sft_index": 0, "meta": {"path": "../../data/raw_data/hhrlhf/helpful-online/dev.jsonl", "line_num": 291, "task": "dialogue"}}

Also avoid clogging your skin with excess oil, which can also lead to blackheads.\n-Don’t try to forcefully push the blackheads back into your skin, since if you do this you may cause scarring or irritation.  Instead you can try massaging a mixture of milk and sugar or honey onto your face.  This helps remove the oil from your pores, which allows the blackheads to puncture and then be easily wiped away.\n-If you do have blackheads that are very deep set into your skin you may need to see a professional exfoliator.

Try not to touch your face too much, and make sure to wash your face with a gentle cleanser daily.  For your skin’s specific needs, you can also experiment with certain salicylic acid-based products, which help unclog pores that get clogged up with excess skin oil.  Moisturizing regularly helps improve the health of your skin too.  If you find that you’ve already developed blackheads, also make sure to use noncomedogenic skin products, which help reduce clogging.  Bleaching products are not recommended, since they can actually make blackheads worse and cause more long-term damage to your skin.

Both freezing and dehydration can be good options for preserving fresh food, although dehydration is generally a better option for most fruits and vegetables.  The advantage of dehydration is that it can preserve the quality and flavor of the food much better than freezing, and it is especially good for delicate fruits and vegetables.  On the other hand, freezing is easier and more convenient because it is quicker, there is no special equipment required, and you don’t have to worry about proper storage conditions for the food.  Another advantage of freezing is that the texture of the food does not change significantly, while dehydration can cause the texture of the food to become quite fragile.  Overall, dehydration is a good option for preserving the quality of delicate foods such as tomatoes and berries, while freezing is generally a better option for vegetables and other sturdier foods.  In most cases I would recommend picking the most convenient method for storing your food, which will depend on your personal preferences and the type of food you are preserving.  If you like the idea of dehydrating your foods, it is worth noting that there are many creative ways to flavor dried foods, such as using herbs, spices, or smoking", "Definitely freezing is better if you just want to preserve tomatoes as long as possible.  Freezing retains the original flavor and texture of the tomatoes better than dehydrating, so frozen tomatoes will taste closer to fresh tomatoes.  Also freezing reduces weight loss and nutrient loss in the tomatoes, and is generally a more efficient and effective method for preserving.  Dehydrating is not quite as good as freezing, but is still a good option to preserve tomatoes.  Dehydrating retains the color and flavor of the tomatoes better than freezing, so the tomatoes will still taste close to fresh.  Also dehydrating is much more energy efficient than freezing, since it only requires the energy to run the dehydrator, while freezing requires the energy to run the freezer AND keep the contents frozen.  Overall, if you just want to preserve the tomatoes as long as possible, you should probably stick with freezing, although dehydrating is also an effective option.  However if you want to save energy and maximize shelf life, dehydrating is probably the better option.  So it really depends on what’s most important to you.  Hope that helps!

Isaac Newton made numerous contributions to physics which laid the foundations for scientific progress, particularly in the fields of mechanics and physics. His most famous and important work was his discovery of the laws of motion, which explained how the planets and stars move through the universe and influenced the development of mechanics and physics in general. In addition to this, Newton published several key papers on optics. He discovered that white light is composed of various different-colored light beams, which is why he refers to his discovery as the “chromatic spectrum.” Newton also developed the first version of an improved telescope, which had a reflecting mirror and could be used to view distant objects more clearly. Furthermore, Newton is credited as the inventor of calculus, making it easier to use and expanding it in new directions."], "reward": [1.662278652191162, 1.4391545057296753], "sft_index": 0, "meta": {"path": "../../data/raw_data/hhrlhf/helpful-online/dev.jsonl", "line_num": 392, "task": "dialogue"}}

However, a variety of tests can be used to assess many aspects of a child’s level of intelligence.  Some of these tests can be done during infancy, or as early as a few months.  For example, a simple “Baby IQ” test that gauges a baby’s visual interest in bright colors or sounds can be used to assess their general attention and alertness.  A “Baby GOAT” satellite test is an “open-ended” test that assesses a baby’s behavior using things like illustrations of animals or familiar tools.  There are also more “standardized” tests, like the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, which are typically administered between ages 1 and 4 years.  While these later tests do yield valuable information about a child’s cognitive development, there is much debate about the use of these standardized tests on infants and toddlers, as the results are influenced by many factors beyond just intelligence, such as environment, cultural influences, and the attentiveness of the parent.", "“Intelligence testing” is definitely something that researchers have looked at for very young children.  These tests are called “mentia” tests, and they’re usually designed for babies and young children between 3 and 5 years old -- although some researchers do focus on younger and older children as well.  Studies show that, even at a very young age, these tests can indicate which children will later end up scoring higher and lower on intelligence tests in adulthood.  Scientists think this is because measure of intelligence is partially related to the way the brain develops over time, especially in early childhood."], "reward": [1.1280077695846558, 1.1731103658676147], "sft_index": 0, "meta": {"path": "../../data/raw_data/hhrlhf/helpful-online/dev.jsonl", "line_num": 574, "task": "dialogue"}}

The U.S. ranks 16th, but this is based on data from 2015, and there are indications that in recent years the U.S. may be doing better.   It's also important to remember that many countries have taken steps towards improving their air pollution problems;  for example, China, the U.S., the EU, and several other nations have approached the Paris Climate Agreement as a framework for limiting global warming.  It's also important to remember that many people globally don't have access to basic public health services, particularly in India and China, and so there's lots more to be done in these countries to protect public health in the short term.

In addition, the “Age of Discovery” is also associated with the navigating attempts of the Italian explorer Giovanni Caboto, better known as John Cabot.

A permanent British colony was established at Roanoke Island, but a second and later colony failed to survive in 1590.   While these were English explorations, Italian explorers Giovanni da Verrazzano and Amerigo Vespucci had also been successful in repeating Columbus’s voyages to the New World.

I hope this helps!", "When selecting corn for grilling, try to choose freshest, sweetest ears of corn you can find.  Corn kernels become sweeter and more tender as the corn matures, so the younger the corn, the tougher and less sweet the kernels will be.

Additionally, try to select corn with nice, milky kernels and a firm, hearty texture.  Dried out or shriveled kernels are a sign the corn is past its prime.  Avoid any corn with cuts, cracks, or other blemishes, as these areas may cause kernel spoilage during cooking.  Finally, be sure to store corn in a cool, dry place whenever possible before grilling, as too warm or moist of conditions will cause the corn to spoil more quickly.

The song “Rhiannon” by Fleetwood Mac is a beautiful, mystical masterpiece. It was written by Stevie Nicks in the 4th grade. The song was first recorded by LeAnn Rimes in 1998, and was then released the same year as an official single by Fleetwood Mac, after Nicks rejoined the band in 1997. The song became a new favorite by new generation fans of the band. A standout lyrical melody in the song is the spirited chant of “Rhiannon, won’t you stay?” repeated with each dramatic modulation in the quickly shifting musical composition. Overall, the song maintains a mysterious and magical atmosphere with strong imagery of dreamlike images, dark moors, dragons, witches and lovers, classic elements of mystical and fantasy genres in music, fused with “guitar-driven epic rock song” style.

If you’re interested in horror, there are quite a few shows I’d recommend. I think “The Walking Dead” is a great option, just because it’s a very popular show, and the TWDM Comics it’s based on are quite well-known and frequently praised by fans of the genre. The show is about a small group of survivors living in post-apocalyptic Georgia where zombies have taken over. It follows the emotional journey of Rick Grimes, the former Sheriff of a small town called Woodbury who wakes up after being in a coma for several months to discover that the world has been overrun by zombies. He quickly teams up with Morgan Jones, a father trying to protect his teenage son, whose town has also been overrun. The focus is on these characters and small groups of others trying to survive, and it deals with questions of morality and doing what is best to protect the people you care about. Actors include Andrew Lincoln, Norman Reedus, and others. I think most people enjoy it, but if you have any other favorite horror movies or TV shows, feel free to tell me about them too!"], "reward": [0.13697156310081482, 0.5657427906990051], "sft_index": 0, "meta": {"path": "../../data/raw_data/hhrlhf/helpful-online/dev.jsonl", "line_num": 905, "task": "dialogue"}}

According to quantum physics, the cat is both alive and dead at the same time until you open the box and look inside, because the cat’s state is a kind of quantum superposition of being both alive and dead.

These changes reduced delivery time from about 24 hours to 5 to 8 hours.\nHumans still used public posts for mail at town centers into the 20th century, but the new system for personal mail delivery is now standard throughout the world.", "Prior to the mid-19th century in the US, mail was distributed at public posts located at town centers. In the 1840s new design reforms were introduced to standardize the delivery, packaging, sorting and route of letters being sent and distributed through the new US Postal Service. These reforms included newspapers and public mail boxes, and were implemented after Congress approved an act establishing a national postal system in 1845. America was certainly not the first country to introduce a postal system to deliver mail, and in fact were a little late to the party, with mail delivered somewhat informally throughout Europe for many decades prior to this."], "reward": [0.7666925191879272, 0.41214606165885925], "sft_index": 0, "meta": {"path": "../../data/raw_data/hhrlhf/helpful-online/dev.jsonl", "line_num": 236, "task": "dialogue"}}

A variety of conditions are associated with allergies, such as skin sensitivity in response to contact, breathing issues, nausea, problems with digestion, and impaired reproductive function.  Many foods share some common allergens -- for instance, with avocado and bananas you’re most often allergic to broad members of the plant family (such as latex, grains, fragrances, and shellfish).  However, those allergies don’t predict or necessarily associate with reactions to other types of allergens.  Additionally, most allergens enter the body in a variety of different ways, whether it’s through breathing, eating, skin contact, etc.  And many allergic reactions don’t have any obvious “trigger”, as they can develop gradually over time with no obvious link to common allergens.

There are many different biological and behavioral explanations that could account for your observation.  One possible explanation is that some cats have a genetic predisposition to be extra affectionate and loving, and other cats do not.  Another possibility is that the friendly cat was simply more comfortable with being touched and petted as a young kitten, and has since grown out of that behaved.  A third possibility is that the more friendly cat has been trained to show affection through touch, by receiving positive rewards, such as treats or attention, whenever he purrs.  The less friendly cat may have instead been rewarded for other behaviors, such as aggression, so he does not purr as much in response to touch.  In general, cats are very individualistic and respond to different situations in varying ways, so there is not really any single major reason that can explain why your cats behave the way they do.

The most likely explanation I can think of is that each cat is a very complex individual with a unique set of personality traits and preferences.  Cats act differently based on their temperament and past experiences, and your cats are no exception.  The cat that purrs all the time is probably a very affectionate and loving cat, and the other cat is much more aloof and independent.  It is common for cats to become less affectionate with age, as they become more self-assured and secure in their sense of self.  It is also common for older cats to be grumpier and more miserly with their affection, as they have more important things to attend to in their daily lives.  Overall your cats sound like normal feline specimens, and I suspect they will both continue to be sources of much joy and amusement for you in the future!

For example, as social media has become prominent, child therapists are occasionally contacted by parents whose children have gone through a significant social or emotional event.  These children and their parents are often unaware that professional therapy is available, and instead ask for online support through social media.  Networking with a larger number of peers can also be a benefit to youth, providing them with access to advice and guidance from other youth, and can help children to build their self-esteem and increase their motivation to cope with stress more effectively.", "Social media has many benefits to youth.  While social media can also provide many benefits to youth, it’s important for them to engage with social media in a safe and healthy way.

As a beginner, start by trying to stand up in the shallows or the whitewater of a wave before working up to riding full waves until you gain confidence and skill.\n- Take regular breaks and pay attention to your own well-being and safety. Rest when you need to and cool down and hydrate often.\n- Take an introductory surfing course and practice in the shorebreak and protected water until you've gained the necessary skills and confidence to ride bigger waves in rougher water.\n- Most importantly, remember to have fun!

You'll also need to know how to swim, as this is important for safety when surfing and accessing the beach. In terms of learning tips, one of the most important skills to learn first is balance on the board. Once you feel confident standing up on the board in shallow water, you'll want to practice building momentum as the waves come in, and then getting up on the board and riding the wave in. The timing of this is extremely important!

Most flowers contain male stamen and female pistils, and rely on pollination by pollinators to reproduce. Since flowers require the transfer of genetic information between plants, it’s rare for a flower to be 100% self-fertilizing, or self pollinating. A notable exception is figs, which contain both male and female flowers, and are self pollinated due to a large opening in the base of the flower which allows pollen transfer between stamen sections.  On the other hand, most seeds/fruits that you’ll find at the grocery store come from plants that are self-pollinating. This is because many gardeners don’t want fruit trees dripping with pollen, and fertilizing nearby plants, so they produce fruits without the necessary stamen and pistil sections for pollination -- in many cases, both fruit cultivation and domestication for farm purposes were efforts to reduce or get rid of the dangerous male stamen and female pistil sections of the plants."], "reward": [0.5774366855621338, 1.326756477355957], "sft_index": 0, "meta": {"path": "../../data/raw_data/hhrlhf/helpful-online/dev.jsonl", "line_num": 547, "task": "dialogue"}}

The dangerous nature of American football has been discussed regularly throughout the history of the sport, and the sport has seen many problematic incidents. Early American football was especially violent, a factor in making it financially unviable for most colleges before the early 20th century. Football equipment was also quite deficient at the time, with flimsy leather helmets and no facemasks or padding on the knees and shoulders. The issue is ongoing today, and tension persists between the lobbying groups seeking to improve the sport’s safety and intense concerns over potential reductions to the popularity and financial success of American football from such regulation. Official fatality rates in the contemporary U.S. National Football League are correspondingly very low by comparison to the general population, and the enormous popularity of football also spawns extensive medical and technological investment toward better concussion mitigation and prevention. Still, concerns about safety continue to be widespread and have taken formal legislative and legal forms.", "It is true that throughout the history of American football, more and more safety features have been added or improved in order to reduce the risks of injury. The safety of football players was not always widely considered an important issue. Before the 1920s, football equipment was quite basic. Helmets were not even permitted in the earliest years of the game, and towards the end of the 19th century players were more often knocked unconscious than injured seriously enough to require hospital care. Many medical journal articles from the late 19th and early 20th century include reports of fatalities or debilitating injuries caused by football. Beginning in the 1920s, many new rules, equipment, and techniques were developed to make football a safer sport. Notably the American College Rules Committee passed significant rule changes in 1920 and 1929 in response to many deaths on the field. New types of equipment began to improve safety dramatically, including the use of protective padding, new rules regarding blocking and tackling, safety zones protected by referees, and helmet standards and rules. Today, all top football leagues around the world strive to prevent injuries and provide a minimal risk level for all players. These regulations also protect against catastrophic brain and spinal injuries, as they are some of the most serious risks of injury in football.
