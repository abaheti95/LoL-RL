Ants can be incredibly frustrating to get rid of, as they can become established in houses very easily and tend to travel by the thousands.  \nTo get rid of them, I recommend two approaches: First, you should try to control their access to your home. Ants typically travel in and out of houses through various cracks and seams. Try caulking or filling in the cracks with spray foam, or using sticky tape and glue to secure any entry points you find. Inspect the exterior of your home for any cracks or gaps that may attract pests. You also need to store your garbage outside and remove crumbs and food from your home to deter insects. \nSecond, you can use baits and ant poisons to repel and kill those that do get in, if you can’t control their access. The baits are available at most hardware stores, and there are also sprays that you can use outdoors and inside your home.\nLet me know if you have any questions. I’m happy to help!", "Ants are generally not a serious threat, but if you want to get rid of them, you can try leaving dishes unwashed in the kitchen, keeping counters and floors dry and clean, and exterminating them using specially formulated ant bait or ant traps.

Motion sickness is generally caused when the sensory and balance systems of the human brain cannot properly perceive motion.  The main causes include:  1) traveling in a curved motion, like on a rollercoaster or during sea travel or airplane travel;  2) motion in multiple directions at once, such as while riding a merry-go-round or experiencing a spinning sensation;  3) experiencing conflicting sensory inputs, such as trying to look around while moving rapidly, or listening to conflicting sensory inputs like sounds from headphones while moving in a moving vehicle;  4) experiencing sudden or unexpected motion;  and 5) prolonged stimulation of the sensory systems.  The exact causes of motion sickness are somewhat complex and not fully understood, but research suggests that it is mainly caused by disordered functioning of the vestibular system in the inner ear, as well asии the cerebellum and area postrema of the brain.

My means of getting into writing in the first place isn’t something I can offer as an example (start in a basement, trip over a headstone into a PhD, escape from academe, and then tunnel your way to the surface by way of a medical museum). But there are a few habits that carry over from project to project. Here are my top five:\nBook buying. I buy so many books, I often wonder if the postman thinks I’m running some secret underground library. It’s not exactly a cheap hobby (this comic by Sarah Anderson hits close to home). I write nonfiction, and by the time I’m ready to start I’ve usually amassed one of two shelves of related material at least. My talismans! My fortifying wall! My wallet is empty! I think new or young writers worry that what they read will color their own writing too much — or fear that they will accidentally “steal” someone’s style. But we are all in dialogue with every writer we’ve encountered; the solution is simply to read many more books. I’ve said this before: All books are natural siblings. Buying them supports fellow writers, too.\nYellow car spotting. Once I’ve collected materials, I sit down to read. But the books I read are not always the ones I will reference in the writing.

So much of what we do as writers comes down to pattern recognition. I like to call it Yellow Car Spotting. If you are planning to buy a yellow car, you will suddenly see them everywhere. And if you are working on a project, everything you read will help that project along in some way.\nCalendaring. We live in an age of conflicting schedules. Even in the present pandemic-fueled work-from-home revolution, there are still enormous draws on everyone’s time. If you have a job (most writers have secondary employment), there are the various necessities of keeping it. If you have pets, they need walking, cleaning, feeding. If you have kids, oh my God. Your time isn’t even yours. That’s why I hate the “work this time of day, for this long” advice. You can’t predict your days... but you can calendar them. Not usually a verb, but I’ve learned to weaponize this feature for my benefit. I make blocks of writing time and I won’t let myself schedule other things in those blocks. They can be any size, they can move, they can skip days. And I don’t have to write during the blocks if I don’t feel like it. Sometimes I just use them as a break from overscheduling. That extra thing someone asked you to do, suddenly, because it would just take a teeny amount of your time? Can’t. It’s been calendared.\nLunch. Obviously, one must eat. But I use my lunches to meet with a fellow writer. I’m very lucky, in that we both live in the same city and usually manage to meet twice a week during our lunch breaks — but it can be done remotely, too. (I know because we were forced by Covid to work out a system using Google chat.) This is one habit that I hope never to be without because meeting regularly with someone who also writes, and so understands the peculiar twists a mind gets into while working out the manuscript kinks, is utterly invaluable. I’m not sure how any writing gets done properly without interlocutors — I am very certain mine suffers cruelly when they’re missing.

Community is a very big deal in what can be an isolating experience.\nActual writing. I have no idea how to make this one sexy. When it all comes down to it — writing is, of itself, a habit.

Proper back exercise and stretching can help relieve back pain and prevent damage to the spine. Low back pain and spinal health are very serious and should be dealt with by licensed professionals only. For back pain or other injury, I would always recommend seeing a medical professional for diagnosis and suggested treatment, always consulting your own personal physician as well. Examples of good conditions for lower back exercises are walking, bicycling, jogging, swimming, rowing, and other moderate to low-impact aerobic exercise. Stretching of the major lower back muscles (i.e., the gluteus maximus and hamstrings) is also strongly recommended, and may be accompanied by relaxation techniques such as deep breathing and visualization. It is also important to maintain healthy posture and avoid slouching or twisting the spine when lifting, working, or playing. When performing back exercises, it is very important to be mindful of proper posture, alignment, and form, and to avoid exercises that involve twisting or those which may cause injury to the lower back. Individuals with osteoporosis or underlying back conditions should seek medical guidance before beginning any exercise regimen.

Yoga and Pilates are excellent forms of exercise with a solid evidence base demonstrating significant lower back pain relief and improved overall spine health with regular practice.  Additionally, Tai Chi and Qi Gong practice have been shown to provide significant long term benefits for lower back pain -- these are forms of gentle, mindful exercise which emphasize awareness of natural breathing, movement, and the deliberate control of the spine and other body parts in a slow and graceful sequence of movements and postures.

I can explain that using a few common terms that describe different kinds of probabilities.  We use the word “probability” to describe the likelihood of different events happening in the world.  This is usually based on observed data, but can also sometimes be based on assumptions or beliefs.  There are three main types of probability that people usually talk about: “probabilistic” (to describe an uncertain outcome), “equiprobable” (which can describe equal chance), and “prescribed” (when you assign the probability of a certain outcome).  \nSo you can use probabilities in situations where there are several possible outcomes, which we call “events”, and it is hard to know what the outcome will be, we call this a “probabilistic” situation.  For example, when I roll a die, I don’t know what number will come up!  You could say the “probability” of rolling a 4 is 1/6", "Sure. In general, the number of possible outcomes of a dice-roll is called its “cardinality”, which is six. In other words, if we have three dice, the number of possible outcomes is six cubed, which is 6 * 6 * 6. To put this in perspective, if we roll one die, the total number of possible outcomes is one, and two dice have 12 possible outcomes, and so on. The reason this gets a bit more complicated is that we need to consider the outcomes in the context of probability.  \nWhen it comes to probability, there’s a branch of mathematics called “combinatorics”, which can help us model the probability of different possible outcomes of a dice-roll.  \nTo give you an example, consider a dice-roll, with three dice.
